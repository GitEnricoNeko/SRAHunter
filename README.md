# SRAHunter 

## Description
SRAHunter is a set of tools designed to facilitate the downloading and processing of data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). This package includes two main scripts: a Python script for data processing and a Bash script for data retrieval and preprocessing.

## Contents
- `SRA_download_and_dump_from_list.py`: This script processes input files containing SRA accession numbers, performs various data manipulation tasks, and checks system requirements like available disk space.
- `SRA_full_metadata.sh`: This Bash script handles the retrieval of metadata from the NCBI SRA database, splits large input files into manageable chunks, and organizes the fetched data.
